# Outstanding Questions/Decisions
* how to handle gap between historical & forecasts?


# To Do
* error handling
    * api doesn't have weather
    * form isn't filled out fully
    * make two diff forms? one for zips one for other stuff so we can use the required functionality
* styling & layout
    * hide chart names when no chart
    * own legend? fix legend
* add listener to aggregation drop down
* segmented controls https://codepen.io/S-Maas/pen/NrYvdK

* organize project into clear files

# Bonus functionality 
* slot machine
* option for 3/5/10 year averages
* current forecast view for multiple locations
* auto complete search options
* international data??
* stacked bar char for rain & snow instead of percipitation
